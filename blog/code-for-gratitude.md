#  My Code for Gratitude

The quality of being thankful, readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness. That's how a dictionary would define it.

For me gratitude the medicine of our disease, the cure for our pain and the end of suffering.

It is luckily accessible to all of us. Probably compulsory prescribed to all of us.

You know, I usually read and hear what people say about gratitude, they are mostly appreciating what they have in life (and mostly associated with material). But what if we have nothing (materialistically) of any value! What would we be grateful for?

When I think about gratitude this way, I discover those things that we naturally forget about, that without them we probably have no life. Let me share with you some:

1. How great to be able to wake up every morning?!
2. How great to be able to breath naturally without the need for a ventilator to drive your lungs?! You don't even do anything about it, it is happening automatically!
3. How great to be able to differentiate between colours?!
4. How great to be able to reason and intellectualise?!
5. How great to be able to walk?! using only two legs!

... the list goes on for me ...

And the metaphor goes like this, when you are grateful for the roof above your head, this opens a little door in this roof, and when you look behind you see more room, then you become more grateful, then another little door opens another room above, and then you become more grateful, then another door opens, and it goes on and on.

That's my code for gratitude. What is your code?

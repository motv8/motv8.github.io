# Upgrade to First-class | Mindset flight

In the beginning, There was neither existence nor non-existence, All this world was unmanifest energy ... The One breathed, without breath, by Its own power, Nothing else was there - Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda.

Your mind, a workshop, where all magic being prepared. It is the production environment in which you code and program your dream to create. Human beings are resourceful and whole, we don't need external resources to create, it is all built-in and available within. Someone said: everything in this world was just a though in the mind of someone before it became real. Do you know how powerful that is? Everything you can see, smell, eat and touch now, was just a thought swimming in the unknown world within us!!

Fear then limits us to tap on these resources within us. Fear puts layers of dust on our gift, our talents, you can barely see it. Just like the black rock with diamond within.

Well, fear is a product of our environment: place we live in, people we live and interact with, the job that we do, system that we follow, even food, sun and water plays and important role in our environment. It is just like you're put into a jar with many other things that someone else has chosen for you. No but in reality it is not like that, you've a choice. Either you choose to accept what is being put in the jar for you, and the cap that is closing the jar, or you use the power of your mind to expand beyond your jar, blow up the cap and free yourself.

God has created us different, and that's fair, because everyone of us was sent for a different purpose in life. Your uniqueness is your greatness. It is our responsibility to show the world our uniqueness, our greatness. How many people has come to this world and left without sharing their greatness with us, how many great songs were not sang, how many great books were not written, how many great recipes were not cooked, all buried with them. How many insane ideas just died out because they visited the thoughts of someone of us but he/she who assumed to host them, turned them down. It is our responsibility to manifest these ideas and bring them to reality.

The only way to overcome this fear to un-dust our greatness and access our gift is to keep growing and keep improving our environment. Stop blaming your parents for being born poor, stop blaming the government for not supporting you, stop relaying on the external resources. Start tapping on the internal resources because this is where magic takes place and the unmanifest becomes manifest.

Take the next mindset flight and go to unvisited destinations within you. They probably are the most fascinating places to explore in this life. But wait, don't just fly economy, you know why, just because you can upgrade to First-class.

Listen, first class is not expensive, what is more expensive is flying always economy and missing out the magical experience. Opting to flying always economy means you're wasting time, there is no fast track in economy. Here is what I'm suggesting:

Expose yourself to First-class elements in your external environment to train your mind what's possible, already there and available. If your mind is powered by "it is possible", then next thing automatically happens, what could I possibly create even better, bigger and crazier within me?!
Surround yourself with OQP: Only Quality People. Quality people may or may not see what magic incubated inside you (your gift), but they surely are the likes of you who are working on themselves and growing all the time. They're hungry for more and not accepting to be imprisoned in their jars. Those people will help you fire and wire new circuits inside your brain. They are multiplying the mindset signal that "everything is possible". Hey, If you're the best in your circle, you must be worried about yourself, you entered the comfort zone. Life happens only beyond the comfort zone. You cannot create magic in the comfort zone, Life is just is.
Know your gift. Your gift is the thing you do at your absolute best with the least amount of efforts. I was so glad when I first learned this definition. Ain't no education needed, no training course needed, no certificates needed, these are all man-made rules they don't have anything to do with the internal world of your gift. Your gift is born with you, oh God this is sweet. It is already there, ain't no need for someone to approve or validate it. It is a given power, you only need to turn on the light and plug yourself into the field of infinite potentiality.
Recall your gift from the time when you were between 7 and 14 years old. This is usually the time we first did practice our gift before someone else puts it into the jar and close the lid. Have you watched the movie "The Truman Show"? You better discover your gift before someone else discovers it and makes use if it in his/her favour. Ask your parents if they're still alive or hire a coach to explore with you this time of your life.
Use your gift because if you don't use it, it will become dusty and will disappear again. The more you use your gift, the happier you will be. Here is something magical that happens to everyone regardless their job, life style or financial status: if you find someone happy, creative, helpful and radiating energy, those people are doing something with their gift. Have you ever noticed one of those people working in a clothing shops, she is coming to you with a big smile and asking you, instead of "can I help you", she'll tell you, "Birthday or Wedding?" and then she takes you through the most amazing experience in your life, finding something for you to wear you've never thought about? It is their convincing energy. Have you been in a public toilet and saw the janitor welcoming you with a big smile (not waiting with toilet papers and expecting some tips) he is just there singing and proud of how clean he made this place shine and how great it smells welcoming people to enjoy their relief experience?! And when you're done, he will tell you: "thank you for visiting my office today"?! They are not complaining about their job, life or financial status. That's is someone gifted gifting their gift to the world.
So please upgrade your mindset to first-class and fly everyday to the most magical placed within you, it is free, no passport needed and it is effortless (just close your eyes and meet everyone you want to meet, eat what you want to eat and listen to the music you love).

Don't forget when you land and get back, write down those thoughts and include them into your dreams list, your vision board is hungry for more. You know that writing down thoughts is the first step in manifesting them and bringing them to reality?! Read your dreams list everyday, if you could do it day and night. This is called mind rehearsal. This is when your mind gets super charged and starts collapsing waves (thoughts) into particles (material world).

Please like and share, sharing is caring. There must be people out there that need to hear these words. don't let them stop at you, pass them forward. Don't forget to read my previous writes.


My passion is to help others tap onto their full potential. I use my strengths to the best I could do to help others discover their values, use their strengths and define their life purpose to achieve their dreams. I also have a day job that inspires me and charges my daily career life battery. I work with smart and motivated people and I communicate daily with clients that fire and wire creative circuits in my brain. I'd be glad to share some of my energy and experience with anyone interested to grow and develop themselves. Keep well.

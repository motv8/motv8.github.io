# Born to Lead

Today my son turned 2.5 years old. His midwife carried him on day 1 and said to us (my wife and I): you have got a leader.
A leader?! I wondered. How could you possibly tell in an early age who he is, or what he is going to be?!
As the days and months unfold, my wife and I recognized a pattern.
Whenever we went for a big decision, since he was born, there was a voice that influenced our decision.
We went to buy our first car, have been wandering around for quite a time checking features, prices, suppliers that we may connect with.
Whenever we made a viewing into a car shop that was not meant to match our little leader's decision, he made a noise.
That noise was extremely loud that we couldn't listen to other voices.
And one day we entered a car shop, surprisingly enough the one around the corner where we live, that same leader, fall asleep, deeply. We were thanking the lord left and right for having some serenity to close the deal. Things went well till the signature of the contract, when he suddenly woke up and looked at us with a very strong questioning eyes, what are you both doing here while I'm trying to sleep?! We said, Hey what do you think about this car? Do you like it? He smiled! That was absolutely mind blowing for us. How could someone be that strong, confident and natural at the same time in leading others and taking charge of their decision making.

We are all born from the same source, the source of pure intelligence, pure potentiality.
The source which doesn't know fear, doubt or impossibility. We are born to lead not to follow.
A leader who has big sense of direction, doesn't take 'No' as an answer, and who doesn't worry about the consequences of his/her decision because they have got a high level of intuition that will lead to success, joy and happiness. And that is the type of leader we all born with.

Our environment conditions our minds, we tend to label everything. There is black and white, thin and fat, man and woman. Regardless who you are, we are all made of the same mix: body, mind and soul. And originated from the same source of infinite possibilities.

My son was my greatest teacher during the last 2.5 years. Since he was born, I decided to let go my old thoughts, fears, doubts that I gained from the society, the family and the culture I grew up with. I made this as an experiment and promised myself to take responsibility for the outcomes, no matter what is it.

I'm sharing this story with all of you to simply advise you: stop teaching your children and start learning from them. They come from the world of pure intelligence that we don't live in anymore and they try to enlighten our world with it. If we don't turn attention to them and listen, we will condition them as it was done to us.

I will leave you with this quote that always impresses me: When the student is ready, the teacher will show up everywhere.

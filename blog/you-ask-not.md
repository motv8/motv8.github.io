Said Mr. Harvey, wise words on the go. 


What is holding us back from asking what we want? God has created this all for you and I. So it is not big for him to give you your ask. All what we need to do is to ask him all what we want with the belief that he will give us just because God can. 


Now I don’t care if you are a believer of God or not, I believe God exist and God is the creator of everything including me. But if you don’t, that’s your decision, at least we all know that there is a source of all that, so name it what you think, universe, Abundance or whatever. 


What I know for sure, what brought me to write this down and share it with you all, there are three steps for getting what you want, all what you need is WHAT, the how is none of your business. You won’t be able to figure it out. 


So here are the three fundamental steps in getting what you want:

1. Ask for what you want, if you don’t ask you don’t get. But ask with the believe that you will get it. Be ridiculously insane in what you ask, people have to laugh at you when they hear what you ask for. Ok? 

2. Write it down, in your notes, journal, on your walls, mobile phone, anywhere it doesn't matter. The most important thing is that you write it down somewhere where you can see it every single day. Now listen, the more you detail it the better, for example, if you’re asking for a car, don’t just say: I want a car, write down the brand, colour, type, detail the wheels, the interior, features and so on. If you can detail it, you can visualize it. You must detail it in a way as if you already have and see it now. 

3. Be grateful for what you have and what you ask for. We're mostly grateful for what we have, but now I’m asking you to be also grateful for what you don’t have (yet!) and you are asking for it. You are expecting it. Then let go. 


Don’t think of how you will get it or when. How is none your business and when is the matter of efforts you will put and events you will go through. Again, no how here, just what. You will be guided, road blocks, failures, no-sayers, but also some sun shine. You will be surprised how everything is channeling you towards your ask. 


To give you more substance on that, this technique is based on empowering our mind to convert our thoughts (none material life, quantum field) into material life (traditional law of physics apply). You are the creator of your world (believe it or not). If you can’t use the power of your mind in manifesting your dreams into reality, you are opting to live the mediocre people’s life (that's 95% of the people). That’s your decision no one can blame you, but know one thing for sure, if you don’t ask you don’t claim your share in this life. Someone else (the rest of 5%, people living in the rare-air) will ask and will be able to claim your share. Simply because they asked (and they put the work needed). 


I wrote this because I had lately a profound experience which blow my mind up and I’d love to see others experience the same. 


If these words resonate with you, please like, share and try it out. There must be people out there who are in need of these words. So don’t let them stop at you, pass them forward and let others have a breakthrough in their lives. 


Leave your comments below if you had a similar experience or tried this technique before. 


My passion is to help others tap on their full potential. I use my strengths to the best I could do to help others discover their values, use their strengths and define their life purpose to achieve their dreams. I also have a day job that inspires me and charges my daily career life battery. I work with smart and motivated people and I communicate daily with clients that fire and wire creative circuits in my brain. I'd be glad to share some of my energy and experience with anyone interested to grow and develop themselves. Keep well.
